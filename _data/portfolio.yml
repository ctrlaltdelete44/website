  introduction: >-
    My second year at Plymouth brought with it an interesting introduction to full-stack development.
    In teams of 4, we were to develop a ticket booking system for trains. This was to incorporate a mobile
    app for customers, a Java desktop app for staff use, and a web app for administration (plus a database
    and web API so they could interact).
    </p><p>
    Unfortunately as a university-managed task, the GitHub repo has since
    been removed.
  summary: >-
    My role in this was building the desktop app, web app, and co-authoring a Java library that handled our
    API connections that we could simply import to every project. The primary lesson I took from this course
    was, well, which frameworks to avoid. I'd be content to not touch Java Swing or Kotlin for the rest of my
    career.

  introduction:
    Alongside my studies, I educated myself in fundamentals of VBA so that I could create a procedurally-
    generated mazemaker in Excel. This, very simply, created a random maze using the Excel sheet as a grid.
    The process was to create a `Master` path from the center of the given range, which would repeatedly select
    'valid' (ie unblocked) adjacent squares until it couldn't find any other valid paths or reached the end of
    the selection.
    </p><p>
    The code would then traverse along this path (with a given step size so you could adjust complexity)
    and create a 'child' path wherever it could.
  summary: >-
    This was created purely as an exercise to see if I <strong>could</strong>. It was used very briefly in
    a Dungeons and Dragons session, but the project ended with vague plans that concepts from it could be
    taken to apply to bigger projects as needed.
    </p><p>
    It was, however, refreshing and exciting at the time
    to work on something entirely for myself; this passion for programming is something I intend to keep.

  introduction: >-
    In preparation for my placement at Plymouth Software, I taught myself the
    basics of Rails and created a test application (following Michael Hartl's wonderful
    <a href='https://www.railstutorial.org'>tutorial</a>). The application earned the colloquial name 'Young Forest'
    following it's deployment to Heroku.
  summary: >-
    The project was expanded beyond the tutorial during my first few weeks on placement as a learning
    exercise. Additional features such as private favourites were added, and the codebase was used as
    a testing ground for significant migrations required in other applications to work out any major issues.
    </p><p>
    This highlighted the importance of spike applications when undergoing new, challenging, or large changes;
    recreate the issue in a smaller, simpler app and work through the problems in a simpler environment first.

    Learning about so many new technologies made me excited to try them outside of work. So I made this!
  summary: >-
    This website is my personal practice in development. I'm using GitHub for version control (and to a
    better standard than I have before) and have it deployed via Netlify. Feel free to check out the repo
    for more information on how it's been built :)

  introduction: >-
    I'll be the first to admit that I have a lot of unresolved issues with Javascript. But, despite my best
    intentions, the programming community are determined to keep digging it up. When a university course
    required us to learn ME*N stack (Angular excluded for health and safety reasons), I decided to take the
    opportunity to learn React as well... And promptly fell in love.
  summary: >-
    Vignette is another gratuitous, self-indulgent project. It's designed to help writers struggling with
    writers block by motivating them to write flash fiction that is posted publicly, anonymously, and deleted
    after 30 days; no pressure, no need to write anything good, just an opportunity to write something.
    It is, in essence, the app I needed in college.
    </p><p>
    At time of writing this is hosted on <a href="https://vignette-app.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>, and
    once university allows I'll make the source code publicly available.
    </p><p>
    Does the colour scheme look familiar?
  outroduction: >-
    This is also around the time I started caring about accessibility. The internet is a wonderful thing,
    and everybody should be able to use it. So a key requirement of this app was it's accessbility - the
    colours chosen are visibly distinct when tested with colourblindness simulators & the site is easily
    navigatable via keyboard. The app scored 95 in Google's Lighthouse test for accessibility, and this is
    the bar I set for myself and developers I deal with.

    And this brings me to now, to this year. At time of writing I'm in my final stage at university, and
    for my course I have complete freedom to make a project of my choice to be developed during the year.
    True to form, I'm making something nerdy and self-indulgent - a Dungeons & Dragons notes organiser.
    </p><p>
    With the complete technical freedom for this project, I've combined some of my favourite things. A
    Ruby on Rails API with a React web app, (soon-to-be) Flutter App, all wrapped in Docker and hosted on
    Heroku.
  summary: >-
    Enter Scription. This is designed to be a quick-reference for notes during a session. You define
    notable characters, locations, or items and then write notes about them. Then should you need to
    fact-check yourself or deal with annoying players, you can quickly see the information about a given
    notable. Once again, this is designed to be accessible-first. To check progress, this app is hosted
    <a href="https://scription-app.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
