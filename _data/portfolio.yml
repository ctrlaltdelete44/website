  introduction: >-
    During my time with the University of Plymouth I have studied C# and Java. Using these I have
    explored the fundamentals of Object Orientated Programming, including the study of design patterns.
  summary: >-
    These skills were used particularly during my second year, in which one assignment called for the 
    development of a Patient Administration System. This was graded on the use of effective (but basic)
    version control, and appropriate use of design patterns.

  introduction: >-
    Working with Plymouth Software has drastically improved my skills both in development and project
    management. I have been working largely with Ruby on Rails - this website itself is a testament to
    that - handling serverside functionality.
  summary: >-
    In preparation for my placement here, I taught myself the
    basics of Rails and created a test application (following Michael Hartl's wonderful [tutorial]). I
    have since been able to expand upon this, and use it as a testing ground for for significant changes
    in other projects.
