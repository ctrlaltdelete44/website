  introduction: >-
    My second year at University introduced full-stack development.
    In teams of 4, we were to develop a ticket booking system for trains. This was to incorporate a mobile
    app for customers, a Java desktop app for staff use, and a web app for administration (plus a database
    and web API so they could interact).
    </p><p>
    As a university-managed task, the GitHub repo has since
    been removed.
  summary: >-
    My role in this was building the desktop app, web app, and co-authoring a Java library that handled our
    API connections. Whilst an interesting task, I'd be content to not touch Java Swing or Kotlin for the rest of my
    career.

  introduction:
    Alongside my studies, I learned basic VBA to create a mazemaker in Excel.
    The process was to create a `Master` path from the center of the given range, which would repeatedly select
    'valid' (ie unblocked) adjacent squares until it couldn't find any other valid paths or reached the end of
    the selection.
    </p><p>
    The code would then traverse along this path (with a given step size so you could adjust complexity)
    and create a 'child' path wherever it could.
  summary: >-
    This was created purely as an exercise to see if I <strong>could</strong>. Despite its lack of
    real-world usefulness, it was a useful introduction to the autonomous learning that has become a
    fundamental skill in my career.

  alt: A path leading into a forest
  introduction: >-
    In preparation for my placement at Plymouth Software, I taught myself the
    basics of Rails and created a test application (following Michael Hartl's wonderful
    <a href='https://www.railstutorial.org'>tutorial</a>). The application earned the colloquial name
    'Young Forest' following it's deployment to Heroku.
  summary: >-
    The project was expanded beyond the tutorial during my first few weeks on placement to improve my
    Rails confidence. The codebase was later used as a testing ground for significant migrations
    required in other applications to work out any major issues.
    </p><p>
    This highlighted the importance of spike applications when undergoing new, challenging, or large changes;
    recreating a problem on a smaller scale can help solve it.

    I was introduced to a lot of new technology at work, and I wanted to experiment with them. So I made this!
  summary: >-
    This website is my place to talk about myself for hours on end. It's deployed via Netlify,
    feel free to check out the repo on my GitHub for more information on how it's been built.

  introduction: >-
    I'll be the first to admit that I have a lot of unresolved issues with Javascript. But, despite my best
    intentions, the programming community are determined to keep it relevant. When a university course
    required us to learn ME*N stack (Angular excluded for health and safety reasons), I decided to take the
    opportunity to learn React as well... And promptly fell in love.
  summary: >-
    Vignette is a gratuitous, self-indulgent project. It's designed to help writers struggling with
    writers block by motivating them to write flash fiction that is posted publicly, anonymously, and deleted
    after 30 days.
    </p><p>
    At time of writing this is hosted on <a href="https://vignette-app.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>, and
    once university allows I'll make the source code publicly available.
    </p><p>
    Does the colour scheme look familiar?
  outroduction: >-
    This application also marks my first steps in caring about accessibility; with no knowledge of WCAG
    I implemented a few features I considered key: keyboard navigation & colourblind-friendly colours.

  introduction: >-
    This brings me to my final year; our dissertations permitted creative freedom to build a project.
    True to form, I made something nerdy and self-indulgent - a Dungeons & Dragons notes organiser.
    </p><p>
    With the freedom to choose the tech stack, I combined my favourite things. A
    Ruby on Rails API with a React web app & Flutter mobile app, all wrapped in Docker and hosted on
    Heroku (or the Google Play store where relevant).
  summary: >-
    Enter Scription. This is designed to be a quick-reference for notes during a session. You define
    notable characters, locations, or items and then write notes about them. Then should you need to
    fact-check yourself or deal with annoying players, you can quickly see the information about a given
    notable. To check progress, this app is hosted <a href="https://scription-app.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
  outroduction: >-
    This application was designed to meet WCAG 2.1 to an AA level, accessible from
    the ground up. And yet, even in the short amount of time since I submitted it, I've learned so many areas
    where I went wrong. I'm absolutely still learning. If you have any advice for somebody in my situation,
    don't hesitate to reach out.
