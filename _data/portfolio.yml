  introduction: >-
    During my time with the University of Plymouth I have studied C# and Java. Using these I have
    explored the fundamentals of Object Orientated Programming, including the study of design patterns.
  summary: >-
    These skills were used particularly during my second year, in which one assignment called for the 
    development of a Patient Administration System. This was graded on the use of effective (but basic)
    version control, and appropriate use of design patterns.

  introduction: >-
    The following semester, we were assigned random groups and given a bigger project than we'd seen before,
    a train booking system. This was to incorporate a mobile app for customers, a Java desktop app for staff
    use, and a web app for administration (plus a database and web API so they could interact). Unfortunately
    as a university-managed task, the GitHub repo has since been removed.
  summary: >-
    My role in this was building the desktop app, web app, and co-authoring a Java library that handled our
    API connections that we could simply import to every project.

  introduction:
    Alongside my studies, I educated myself in fundamentals of VBA so that I could create a procedurally-
    generated mazemaker in Excel.
  summary: >-
    This, very simply, created a random maze using the Excel sheet as a grid. The process was to create a
    `Master` path from the center of the given range, which would repeatedly select 'valid' (ie unblocked)
    adjacent squares until it couldn't find any other valid paths or reached the end of the selection.
    Then the code would traverse along this path (with a given step size so you could adjust complexity)
    and create a 'child' path wherever it could.

  introduction: >-
    Working with Plymouth Software has drastically improved my skills both in development and project
    management. I have been working largely with Ruby on Rails - this website itself is a testament to
    that - handling serverside functionality.
  summary: >-
    In preparation for my placement here, I taught myself the
    basics of Rails and created a test application (following Michael Hartl's wonderful
    (tutorial)[https://www.railstutorial.org/]). I have since been able to expand upon this, and use it
    as a testing ground for for significant changes in other projects.
    At time of writing, this is live (here)[https://www.railstutorial.org/]

  introduction: >-
    Learning about so many new technologies made me excited to try them outside of work. So I made this!
  summary: >-
    This website is my personal practice in development. I'm using GitHub for version control (and to a
    better standard than I have before) and have it deployed via Netlify. Feel free to check out the repo
    for more information on how it's been built
