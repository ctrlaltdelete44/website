  introduction: >-
    My second year at University introduced full-stack development.
    In teams of 4, we were to develop a ticket booking system for trains. This was to incorporate a mobile
    app for customers, a Java desktop app for staff use, and a web app for administration (plus a database
    and web API so they could interact).
    </p><p>
    As a university-managed task, the GitHub repo has since
    been removed.
  summary: >-
    My role in this was building the desktop app, web app, and co-authoring a Java library that handled our
    API connections. Whilst an interesting task, I'd be content to not touch Java Swing or Kotlin for the rest of my
    career.

  introduction: >-
    I'll be the first to admit that I have a lot of unresolved issues with Javascript. But, despite my best
    intentions, the programming community are determined to keep it relevant. When a university course
    required us to learn ME*N stack (Angular excluded for health and safety reasons), I decided to take the
    opportunity to learn React as well... And promptly fell in love.
  summary: >-
    Vignette is a gratuitous, self-indulgent project. It's designed to help writers struggling with
    writers block by motivating them to write flash fiction that is posted publicly, anonymously, and deleted
    after 30 days.
    </p><p>
    At time of writing this is hosted on <a href="https://vignette-app.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>, and
    once university allows I'll make the source code publicly available.

    Does the colour scheme look familiar?
  outroduction: >-
    This application also marks my first steps in caring about accessibility; with no knowledge of WCAG
    I implemented a few features I considered key: keyboard navigation & colourblind-friendly colours.

  introduction: >-
    This brings me to my final year; our dissertations permitted creative freedom to build a project.
    True to form, I made something nerdy and self-indulgent - a Dungeons & Dragons notes organiser.
    </p><p>
    With the freedom to choose the tech stack, I combined my favourite things. A
    Ruby on Rails API with a React web app & Flutter mobile app, all wrapped in Docker and hosted on
    Heroku (or the Google Play store where relevant).
  summary: >-
    Enter Scription. This is designed to be a quick-reference for notes during a session. You define
    notable characters, locations, or items and then write notes about them. Then should you need to
    fact-check yourself or deal with annoying players, you can quickly see the information about a given
    notable. To check progress, this app is hosted <a href="https://scription-app.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
  outroduction: >-
    This application was designed to meet WCAG 2.1 to an AA level, accessible from
    the ground up. And yet, even in the short amount of time since I submitted it, I've learned so many areas
    where I went wrong. I'm absolutely still learning. If you have any advice for somebody in my situation,
    don't hesitate to reach out.
