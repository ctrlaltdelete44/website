  title: Ruby on Rails
  introduction: >-
    Ruby on Rails is a monolithic web app development framework; with a huge developer community
    behind it and an emphasis on convention over configuration, it enables rapid scaffolding of
    applications.
  examples:
    - title: Young Forest
      summary: >-
        In advance of my placement at Plymouth Software, I taught myself the basics of Rails and
        created a test application (following <a href='https://www.railstutorial.org'> Michael Hartl's
        wonderful tutorial</a>). The application earned the colloquial name 'Young Forest' following
        it's deployment to Heroku. The project was expanded beyond the tutorial during my first few
        weeks on placement to improve my Rails confidence.

    - title: Plymouth Software
      summary: >-
        My tenure with Plymouth Software, a Ruby on Rails consultancy, formed the basis of my Rails
        education. Here, my role largely involved the maintenance of large legacy applications. This
        ranged from version upgrades to bug fixes to redesigning UIs to ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance.

    - title: Scription API
      summary: >-
        Following my placement year, I dropped to a part-time contract & returned to complete my final
        year at university. My dissertation project for this, Scription, was my exploration of my ideal
        technology stack; a Ruby on Rails API, consumed by React and Flutter applications, with a
        comprehensive CI/CD pipeline managed by GitHub Actions & Heroku.

    - title: This website!
      summary: >-
        This website is technically not a Rails application, but it deserves an honorable mention & is
        built using Jekyll, which itself is built on Ruby. This website started as a programming experiment -
        Dockerising a Jekyll app - but has evolved into the site you see now. It's deployed via Netlify,
        feel free to check out the repo on my GitHub for more information on how it's been built.

react:
  title: React
  introduction: >-
    React is a Javascript library for writing responsive, componentised front-end applications. I
    was interested in the topic - and have previously written articles on an alternative to it, Vue -
    and my final year at university provided an opportunity to learn the framework alongside my course.
  examples:
    - title: Vignette
      summary: >-
        When a university course required us to learn ME*N stack (Angular excluded for health and safety
        reasons), I decided to take the opportunity to learn React as well. Vignette is the product of this;
        it's designed to help writers struggling with writers block by encouraging them to write flash
        fiction that is posted publicly, anonymously, and deleted after 30 days.
