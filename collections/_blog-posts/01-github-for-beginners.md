### Content warning: this article covers serious basics - if you're at all familiar with GitHub & version control, you're going to get bored *very* quickly

At time of writing, I've just finished the second year of my CompSci degree and am taking a placement year in industry. Two years ago, I had absolutely no programming experience and I'm sure there are other people in a similar situation. Here's what I wish somebody had told me...

## 1. Make a GitHub profile, and put everything on there.
If your course is structured anything like mine, you might not encounter Git *at all* until second year. Given that it's such a fundamental part of this field, this is unacceptable. GitHub will become your public technical profile, a way to share your work with others and an access point like a portfolio you can show to employers.

### What is it?
GitHub is used for version control. Whenever you make a significant change to your code, you upload the change (called a 'commit'), and the project (stored in a 'repository') can be rebuilt any number of times using this commit history. For example, my personal [website](https://github.com/ctrlaltdelete44/website) has a repository, and you can see a detailed list of the commit history.

### Glossary of terms
 * **Repository:** The online location of your entire project
 * **Commit:** A change to your code. This is given a message and a unique identifier (a SHA code), which means you can see a clear history of your development and undo steps as needed
 * **Version Control:** The process of uploading incremental changes to your work


### What makes that useful?
The advantages of this that'll be most significant to you are:
 * You can access this code from any computer with an internet connection
 * If you upload a commit


### Sounds great in theory! How do I actually use it?

## 2. Make projects for fun!

## 3. Stay in the loop with technologies you're interested in(?)
## 4. Go to hackathons!
## 5. Use online tutorials
