    During my time with the University of Plymouth I have studied C# and Java. Using these I have
    explored the fundamentals of Object Orientated Programming, including the study of design patterns.
    These skills were used particularly during my second year, in which one assignment called for the
    development of a Patient Administration System. This was graded on the use of effective (but basic)
    version control, and appropriate use of design patterns.

    Alongside my studies, I educated myself in fundamentals of VBA so that I could create a procedurally-
    generated mazemaker in Excel...

    Working with Plymouth Software has drastically improved my skills both in development and project
    management. I have been working largely with Ruby on Rails - this website itself is a testament to
    that - handling serverside functionality. In preparation for my placement here, I taught myself the
    basics of Rails and created a test application (following Michael Hartl's wonderful [tutorial]). I
    have since been able to expand upon this, and use it as a testing ground for for significant changes
    in other projects.
