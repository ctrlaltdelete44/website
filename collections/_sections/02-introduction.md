I'm Anthony - a software development student currently taking a placement at
[Plymouth Software](https://plymouthsoftware.com), which really means I spend
most of my time listening to music and struggling with UI design.

I currently work mostly in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) web apps,
with plans to expand my skills in mobile development (with a particular interest in AR)
using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). This site itself is built on
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (which compiles Markdown, Liquid, HTML & SCSS
into static websites), using [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) for styling and
containerised with [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

You can find the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/ctrlaltdelete44/website).
