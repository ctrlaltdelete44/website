  Anthony is a software developer and student. He is a firm believer in the
  value of small, agile development teams - regular meetings should be held to
  reflect on and plan future progress, and larger teams carry a communication
  overhead that makes this difficult to manage. Equally fundamental is a balance
  between effective communication and bureaucracy - a lack of excess of either
  can lead to a lack of internal organisation or restrictive over-management,
  either of which can infringe on productivity.

  Outside of work Anthony is an avid creator and consumer of literature. He
  specialises in short, introspective fiction and has a growing anthology of
  poetry. In this he is frequently inspired by music (and indeed spends most of
  his life with a backing soundtrack) and the emotions evoked, particularly
  nostalgia and escapism.

  Anthony is a proud advocate for equality, and realises it cannot be achieved
  until marginalised groups are sufficiently supported
