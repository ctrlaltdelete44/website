### [Plymouth Software](https://www.plymouthsoftware.com/)

As a placement year during my studies, I worked as a developer at Plymouth Software, a Ruby on Rails consultancy. I worked closely with clients in a "lower-case 'A' agile" team to complete feature requests and bug reports. Here, I gained valuable experience working with Ruby on Rails for web app & API building, dabbling with modern, reactive front-end frameworks such as Vue.

Beyond this, I worked with Flutter and Dart on an Android and iOS mobile application.

My tenure here continued part-time during my final year, returning to full-time work shortly after.
