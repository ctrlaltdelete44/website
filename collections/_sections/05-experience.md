# Plymouth Software

As a placement year during my studies, I worked as a developer at Plymouth Software, a company specialising in Ruby on Rails consultancy and upgrades. I worked closely with clients in a "lower-case 'A' agile" team to story-point and complete feature requests and bug reports. Here, I gained valuable experience in Ruby on Rails for web application & API building, especially with modern, reactive front-end frameworks such as Vue.

Beyond this, I worked with Flutter and Dart on an Android and iOS mobile application; this similarly provided a refreshing change of pace to use more modern technologies.
